## Introduction

### Motivation and goals

Currently, we're living in a sort of "programming renaissance". Programming and computer science is become more popular then ever -- the number of people interested in majoring in computer science is [growing exponentially](http://www.geekwire.com/2016/computer-science-demand-reaches-new-record-uw-now-top-choice-among-incoming-freshmen/). 

As a consequence, there is an increasingly huge number of resources and tutorials being produced for beginners who want to learn to code, ranging from books to online tutorials to interactive websites to massive open online courses (MOOCS) like Codecademy and Coursera.

While this is great, it can also be overwhelming for beginners -- there are almost too _many_ resources available, and it's difficult to figure out where to start. 

This page is meant to help solve that problem -- to present a **curated** list of resources for people who are either new to programming, new to a particular topic, or want to advance their skills past the beginner stage. This page doesn't try and list every single resource available, but instead links to resources that are guaranteed to be high-quality.

### Where do I start?

If you know what you want to learn about, great! Jump to that section, start browsing the links, and find something which works for you. 

If you're not sure where to start and which language to learn, check out this [visual roadmap based on what you want to focus on](https://github.com/seoweon/developer-roadmap).        
Also [this article](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/this-picture-will-change-the-way-you-learn-to-code-557ac1e109bd) gives some explanation and practical tips on how to read documentation, read source code, debug code, and ask for help. 

If you have a basic idea on where you want to start, here are some good beginner languages:

- [Python](#python) (general-purpose; scientific and mathematical computing)
- [Java _(external link)_](https://github.com/Michael0x2a/curated-programming-resources/blob/master/resources.md#java) (general-purpose; Android development)
- [HTML/CSS/JavaScript](#html-css-and-javascript) (websites and webapps)
- [Scratch](#scratch) (for younger children)

Python and Java are both languages that are [commonly used to teach programming](http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-us-universities/fulltext) to beginners in schools and universities, and so will have a wide variety of resources available to help you learn. They're also both widely used in the industry and so are useful languages to have in your toolbelt.

Web development has been very popular lately, so there are many resources for learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, also making it suitable for learning. It also requires little to no installation and configuration on your computer. All you need is a text editor to write code -- the code will run on your web browser.

Scratch is a little different from other languages. It was designed from the ground up to be easy to use and learn -- instead of typing text, you drag and connect together "blocks" to form programs, making it a very visual language. As a result, Scratch is a good language especially for younger children (elementary schoolers, middle schoolers) or for people who dislike typing.

### How this page is organized

This page is subdivided into three parts -- first, a "General resources" section that links to sites that tend to deliver high-quality content about a variety of topics, and a "Specific resources" section that provides resources on specific programming languages or topics. 

In general, most resources available will fall between two categories -- online courses, and books + tutorials. Online courses tend to teach using video lectures, try and be more interactive, and try and emulate the structure of a course similar to ones you might take in college. In contrast, books and tutorials teach via written text and allow you to set your own pace.

### Which resource should I pick?

Whether you prefer learning by watching a video or reading text is really a matter of personal preference. _I_ personally prefer reading, but your learning style might be completely different. You may need to explore and browse several different resources before you discover how you best learn.

When possible, I'll try and leave a description for each resource describing what their goal is, and what audience they're suitable for. Some resources focus on trying to give a comprehensive introduction for beginners, other resources are more suitable for people who are already somewhat experienced in a language and want to learn more.

### Warning 

This page is still a work-in-progress, and will be updated slowly, time permitting. Some sections may currently be incomplete, and some links may not yet be fully vetted. 

If you would like to contribute, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md][contrib] for details.

## General resources

### Links to other big lists

You can find a large list of [list of free programming books and resources on github](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md). (It used to be hosted on StackOverflow, but was moved over to Github on October 2013).


### Online courses

Online courses are an increasingly popular way for universities and professionals to teach programming and computer science in a structured format. As a result, new online courses will pop up all the time, so it's worth checking these resources periodically to see what's new.

- [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) - offers free online courses in several different languages. However, Codecademy does have a tendency to teach only basic syntax, so you must work through more tutorials after finishing Codecademy. Focuses mainly on web development, Ruby, and Python.
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) - offers free online courses in many different fields from several different well-known universities. New courses are added every quarter, and content from old courses is typically archived. Because many courses appear to be new/may be a one-time thing, this page will not link to courses on Coursera unless it appears to be stable.
- [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/) - offers free computer science courses taught by industry experts. Udacity offers two kinds of courses -- regular courses and nanodegrees. Regular courses are free. Regular courses with one-on-one tutoring/code review requires a monthly fee. Nanodegrees are typically for people with some prior coding experience, and cost more money.
- [edX](https://www.edx.org/) - a joint effort between MIT, Harvard, and Berkeley to provide free online versions of some of their courses.
- [OpenCulture](http://www.openculture.com/computer_science_free_courses) - similar to all of the above. Video lectures are typically available on iTunes or Youtube. Typically does **not** require you to complete assignments, unlike many other online courses.
- [MIT OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) - static course materials taught at MIT. Unless otherwise noted, most content from this website tends to be very rigorous and fast-paced.
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) - contains a few courses on programming and computer science; does contain many more courses on all kinds of topics (especially math).
- [Stanford Engineering Everywhere](http://see.stanford.edu/see/courses.aspx) - static course materials taught at Stanford.

The following websites also contain a wide variety of tutorials for many different topics, but require payment and registration before you can access their courses.

- [Team Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/) - focuses on web and iOS development.
- [Lynda](http://www.lynda.com/) - also includes courses on design, animation, video, business, and more.
- [PluralSight](http://www.pluralsight.com/) - similar to Lynda, but with a focus on developer and IT courses.

In general, edX, OpenCulture, MIT OpenCourseware, and Stanford Engineering Everywhere tend to contain more rigorous, thorough, and demanding courses, whereas Codecademy and Khan Academy tend to focus on giving a more gentle introduction to programming. Coursera and Udacity tend to vary between these two extremes.


## Programming Languages

### Python

Note: there are currently two versions of Python that are commonly taught and used -- Python 2, and Python 3. Python 3 is the most recent version, but for a variety of reasons Python 2 still is fairly popular among many developers.

If you're not sure which version to pick, my recommendation would be to pick the resource which looks like the best fit for you, and just use whatever version they're recommending. Luckily, the differences between the two are very minor (at least from the perspective of the beginner), so there's really no difference if you learn using Python 2 vs Python 3. 

That said, when working on your own programs, I would always pick Python 3 unless you have good reason to otherwise. The Python community, with the exception of a few holdouts, is moving towards Python 3 and abandoning Python 2.

- Setting up Python:
    - Continuum's [Anaconda][anaconda-download]   
      Anaconda is the leading open data science platform powered by Python. The open source version of Anaconda is a high performance distribution of Python and R and includes over 100 of the most popular Python, R and Scala packages for data science. In a nutshell, it's most of the basics you will need to download anyways, so it's easier to just download everything at once to start with. 
    - iPython's [Jupyter notebook installation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#id3) and [how to run it](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running)    
      "As a server-client application, the Jupyter Notebook App allows you to edit and run your notebooks via a web browser. The application can be executed on a PC without Internet access or it can be installed on a remote server, where you can access it through the Internet.   
      Its two main components are the kernels and a dashboard.    
      A kernel is a program that runs and introspects the user’s code. The Jupyter Notebook App has a kernel for Python code, but there are also kernels available for other programming languages.   
      The dashboard of the application not only shows you the notebook documents that you have made and can reopen but can also be used to manage the kernels: you can which ones are running and shut them down if necessary." ([Source](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook#WhatIs))

- Online courses: 
    - edx's [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python][python-mit-intro]  
      The companion book can be [found here][python-mit-intro-book]. The course is designed for beginners, part of a 2-part series, is self-paced, and has an emphasis on computation and data science.
        -   MIT Open Courseware also offers a gentler "lead-in" course designed for those with no programming background that you can take before taking the above: [Building Programming Experience: A Lead-In to 6.001][python-mit-lead-in].
    - MIT Open Courseware's [A Gentle Introduction to Programming Using Python][python-mit-gentle]  
      A gentler version of the above.
    - Coursera's [Programming for Everybody (Python)][python-coursera]  
      For beginners; requires registration.
    - Udacity's [Programming Foundations with Python][python-udacity]  
      Requires some prior programming experience; focuses on object-oriented programming.
    - Team Treehouse's [Python course][python-treehouse]  
      Allows a free 14-day trial, but later requires payment.
- Interactive resources:
    - [LearnPython][python-learn]  
      An interactive online guide that teaches basic Python.
    - [Try Python][python-try]  
      Another interactive online guide.

- Books and tutorials (online):
    - [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python][python-automate]
      A book for complete beginners. It is aimed at office workers, students, administrators, and hobbyists who want to learn how to write practical programs rather than necessarily become software engineers. From the [Invent with Python][python-invent] author.
    - How to Think Like a Computer Scientist ([Python 2 version][python-think-cs-2] and [Python 3 version][python-think-cs-3])  
      A comprehensive introductory text on Python, focusing on teaching computer science fundamentals and problem-solving skills through Python. Suitable for beginners.
    - [Think Python][python-think]  
      Another comprehensive introductory text on Python, with a similar focus as the previous resource. Also suitable for beginners.
    - The official Python tutorial (for [Python 2][python-official-2] and [Python 3][python-official-3]). Moves a little quickly, but is very comprehensive and thorough. This is probably the best resource for experienced programmers who want to learn Python, since it doesn't linger for too long on basic material.
    - [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures][python-problem]  
      A fantastic introduction to data structures and algorithms and other traditional 
      computer science concepts using Python. While it does briefly cover Python syntax,
      it assumes that you already have some basic prior experience.
    - [Dive into Python 3][python-dive]  
      An accelerated introduction to Python. Warning: do NOT use "Dive into Python 2". It's very outdated.

### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Note: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three core technologies that runs on every web browser and makes up every webpage.

HTML is a language used to describe the _structure_ and _content_ of a webpage. CSS is used to describe the _style_ and _appearance_. JavaScript is used to add _behavior_ and _interactivity_.

The recommended learning order is typically to start with HTML and CSS, then move on to learning JavaScript once you feel you've acquired a basic understanding of the previous two.

Also note that HTML and CSS are examples of "markup languages", not "programming languages" and so will feel fairly different from JavaScript. If your goal is to learn just programming, you might want to jump straight ahead to JavaScript (or pick a different programming language!). However, since the main way to actually use JavaScript is through the web browser, you _do_ need to learn HTML and CSS at one point or another.

- Online courses:
    - Codecademy has several courses related to web development.
        - [Make a website][webdev-cc-make-website]
        - [Make an interactive website][webdev-cc-make-interactive]
        - [HTML & CSS][webdev-cc-html-css]
        - [JavaScript][webdev-cc-js]
        - [jQuery][webdev-cc-jquery]
      Please note that Codecademy focuses only on _introducing_ programming languages. It is strongly recommended that you work through a more comprehensive beginner's tutorial after finishing Codecademy.
    - So does Udacity:
        - [Intro to HTML and CSS][webdev-uda-html-css]
        - [JavaScript Basics][webdev-uda-js]  
          Does require some prior programming experience.
    - Open Culture's [Building Dynamic Websites][webdev-open-dynamic]  
      Hosted by Harvard, and covers a wide variety of topics. 
    - Khan Academy has a series of [three courses][webdev-khan] on introductory Javascript that focuses on drawing graphics and animations, and making games.
    - Team Treehouse has a series of courses on [HTML][webdev-treehouse-js], [CSS][webdev-treehouse-css], and [Javascript][webdev-treehouse-js]
